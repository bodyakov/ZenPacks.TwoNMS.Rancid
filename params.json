All configuration is managed inside the Zenoss interface and configs.\r\nNew device configs are being displayed as device components and can be viewed in the component details window.\r\nRANCID uses SVN (Subversion) in the background to keep track of config changes.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"shorthow\">How does it work</h3>\r\n\r\nA new \"zenrancid\" daemon is created which runs RANCID once a day, by default at 02:00 am.\r\nThe Rancid modeler checks the SVN database for config changes and displays each config version as a device component.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"screenshots\">Screenshots</h3>\r\n\r\nCheck the screenshots inside the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\r\n\r\nThis is a regular ZenPack so the standard installation will work if the pre-requisites are met. \r\nRANCID is being compiled (make & gcc) automatically during the installation so the ZenPack only works on Unix. \r\nCurrently it has only been tested on CentOS.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"prereqs\">Pre-Requisites</h3>\r\n\r\nThe following unix packages have to be installed and available in the $PATH for the zenoss user:\r\n\r\n   * expect\r\n   * tar\r\n   * gzip\r\n   * make\r\n   * gcc\r\n   * subversion (CVS is currently not supported)\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"install\">Install</h3>\r\n\r\nIt is recommended to install this package from commandline so that you can see if there were any pre-requisites missing and if the compilation of RANCID was succesful.\r\n\r\nzenpack --link --install=<installdir>/ZenPacks.TwoNMS.Rancid\r\n\r\nIf there were no errors and the folder $ZENHOME/rancid exists then the installation went ok.\r\n\r\nMake sure to restart zopectl and zenhub. If there are any issues while running RANCID the first time then restart zenoss completely.\r\n\r\nMake sure that the new daemon \"zenrancid\" is started: zenrancid status\r\n\r\nPlease note that re-installing the zenpack will remove all files in the $ZENHOME/rancid folder !\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"upgrade\">Upgrade</h3>\r\n\r\nUpgrading the ZenPack is currently not specifically supported. If upgrading will not work then the old version has to be removed before installing the new version.\r\nIt is possible that upgrading will remove all old config files.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"uninstall\">Uninstall</h3>\r\n\r\nUninstalling the ZenPack can be done using the Zenoss web interface or via commandline:\r\n\r\nzenpack --remove=ZenPacks.TwoNMS.Rancid\r\n\r\nPlease note that removing the zenpack will delete all files and folders in $ZENHOME/rancid !\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"monitoring\">Monitor Devices</h2>\r\n\r\nDevices can be added to the RANCID monitoring using the zenoss interface. There is no need to manually populate the RANCID \"router.db\" files.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"firstuse\">First Use</h3>\r\n\r\nBy default no devices will be added to the RANCID monitoring. In order to add a device you have to make sure the zRancid configuration properties are configured.\r\nEnabling the zRancidIgnore property will add the device to the RANCID router.db file and the next time RANCID runs the device will be included.\r\nIf you want to see the different configurations then the Rancid modeler has to be added for the device as well.\r\n\r\nIt may take 2 runs of zenrancid before the configuration of the device will show up as a component. The first run just checks in the device into the Subversion repository and as of the second run the configuration will be stored.\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"zenrancidd\">zenrancid daemon</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"modeler\">rancid modeler</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"zproperties\">zProperties</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"configuration\">Configuration</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"configzenrancid\">zenrancid daemon config</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"configrancid\">rancid.conf</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"configcloginrc\">cloginrc</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"configrouterdb\">router.db</h3>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"caveats\">Caveats</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"todo\">TODO</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"contact\">Contact & Links</h2>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
